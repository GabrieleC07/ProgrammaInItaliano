# Unnamed-Compiler

A compiler written in Rust for learning purposes, contributions are welcomed, especially if they're fixing my atrocious code.


The language, currently unnamed, (Suggestions are very much appreciated :) ) is mostly to create text-based story games, with choices, like "You see 3 armed man in front of you, what do you do? \n
a) Run \n
b) Scream \n
c) Become the most powerful being in the universe and disintigrate them" \n
